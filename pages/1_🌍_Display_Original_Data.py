    This dataset is designed for predicting diabetes status based on several health indicators and lifestyle factors. Below is an overview of the dataset's features:
    
    - **Gender**: Represents the gender of the individual, with values as "Male" or "Female".
    - **Age**: The age of the individual, represented as an integer.
    - **Hypertension**: Indicates high blood pressure presence. It is binary: `0 = No`, `1 = Yes`.
    - **Heart Disease**: Indicates heart disease presence. It is binary: `0 = No`, `1 = Yes`.
    - **Smoking History**: Categorical data that represents smoking status, such as "never smoked," "used to smoke," or "currently smoking."
    - **BMI (Body Mass Index)**: A measure of body fat based on height and weight, represented by float values.
    - **Average Blood Glucose Level**: The average blood glucose level over the past 2-3 months, usually used to monitor diabetes. Represented as floats, typically between `4.0` to `14.0`.
    - **Blood Glucose Level**: The current blood glucose level, typically represented by float values starting from `80 mg/dL` and above.
    - **Diabetes**: Indicates if the individual has diabetes, where `0 = No` and `1 = Yes`.
