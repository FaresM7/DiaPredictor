## Key Features

1. **Diabetes Risk Prediction**  
   - Users can input personal health metrics (e.g., age, BMI, glucose levels, smoking status).  
   - The model predicts the likelihood of diabetes and provides actionable health recommendations.  

2. **Comparative Model Analysis**  
   - Evaluate different models trained on both the original and enriched datasets.  
   - Metrics include **accuracy**, **precision**, **mean squared error (MSE)**, and **R² score**.  

3. **Chatbot Assistance**  
   - AI-powered chatbot offers real-time insights on diabetes risk, prevention, and lifestyle changes.  

4. **Data Preprocessing & Augmentation**  
   - **Imbalanced dataset?** We applied **SMOTENC** to generate synthetic minority class samples.  
   - Features like **gender, smoking history, and outliers** were handled for optimal model training.

## Data Overview

### Original dataset

We used the [Diabetes prediction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset) from Kaggle for training the models and later enhance the dataset.

> [!NOTE]
> This dataset is used strictly for educational and demonstration purposes.


### Data Analysis Before Transformation
Initial data visualization revealed the following:
- A slight drop in diabetes cases between ages 60–70, followed by a sharp increase at 80+.
- Minimal differences in diabetes cases between males and females.
- Nearly symmetrical distribution with minimal differences between mean and median values.
- Quartiles exhibited expected variations across attributes.

### Data Cleaning and Handling
- **Incomplete Data:** Removed incomplete examples using Pandas. Labels were verified to ensure direct labeling.
- **Balancing:** The dataset originally had a 10:1 imbalance favoring non-diabetic cases.
  - **Downsampling:** Majority class reduced to 20% (1:2 ratio).
  - **Oversampling:** SMOTENC (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling for Nominal and Continuous data) was applied to the minority class to balance the dataset while addressing potential overfitting concerns.

### Transformations Applied to Original and Modified Datasets
1. **Splitting:** Dataset divided into Training (70%), Validation (15%), and Test (15%) sets. Initial splits showed a 1:3 imbalance for diabetic cases.
2. **Categorical Data Encoding:** Hot-end encoding converted categorical features into binary columns for model training.
3. **Normalization:** Linear scaling normalized feature values, addressing right-skewed distributions (e.g., age). Z-Score standardization was avoided due to non-normal distributions and minimal outliers.
4. **Removal of Unnecessary Attributes:** Attributes with minimal model impact (e.g., gender, certain smoking history categories) were excluded from the modified dataset.

### Post-Balancing Observations
- Diabetes correlation with age showed a zigzag pattern, with a sharp increase in cases at ages 75–80.
- Slight gender differences in diabetes cases remained.
- Blood glucose levels displayed increased variation after SMOTENC, with standard deviation rising from 40.90 to 52.55.
- Quartiles maintained expected variation, with slightly increased spread compared to the original dataset.

## Chatbot Implementation with Rasa and Streamlit

### Chatbot Interface (Streamlit + Rasa)

#### Importing Libraries
- **streamlit**: Builds the chatbot interface.  
- **json**: Handles structured message data.  
- **requests**: Sends requests to Rasa’s REST API.  
- **time**: Introduces wait times for unavailable servers.  

#### Function Definitions

##### check_server_ready()
- Checks if the Rasa server is running via a **GET request** to `/status`.  
- If unavailable, waits **5 seconds** before retrying.  

##### get_bot_response(user_input)
- Sends user input to the Rasa bot (`/webhooks/rest/webhook`).  
- **Processes responses**:  
  - If multiple bot messages exist, extracts and displays all.  
  - If no response, prompts user to rephrase.  
  - If an error occurs, returns a diagnostic message.  

#### Streamlit Page Setup
- Uses `st.set_page_config()` to define **layout** and **title** ("Chatbot Interface").  

#### Server Readiness Check
- Verifies if the Rasa server is **ready** before loading the chat UI.  

#### Displaying Chat History
- Retrieves conversation history from **session state** and displays previous messages.  

#### Handling User Input
- Uses `st.chat_input()` for **message submission**.  
- Saves user messages in **session state** for persistence.  

#### Communicating with the Bot
- Sends user input to `get_bot_response()` and **displays the bot’s reply**.  

#### Displaying Responses
- Uses `st.chat_message()` to display **user and bot messages** dynamically.  

#### Error Handling
- Detects server issues and informs users if the bot is **unavailable**.


### Chatbot NLU (Natural Language Understanding)

#### NLU (Intent Recognition)
- Extracts **intent** (user’s goal) and **entities** (important details).  
- Example:  
  - **Intent**: `"report_illness"` (User feels unwell).  
  - **Entities**: `"symptoms": "fever, headache"`.  

#### Rules (Predefined Responses)
- Define automatic replies for **specific user inputs**.  
- Example:  
  - **User**: "Hello"  
  - **Bot**: "Hi there! How can I help?"  

#### Stories (Conversation Flow)
- Control **multi-step** interactions.  
- Example:  
  - **User**: "I feel unwell"  
  - **Bot**: "Can you describe your symptoms?"  
  - **User**: "I have a headache and fever."  
  - **Bot**: "I recommend rest and hydration. Would you like medical advice?"  


### Actions (Custom Logic)

#### ActionProvideTips
- **Purpose**: Delivers personalized health advice.  
- **How it works**:  
  - Retrieves user conditions (e.g., smoking, hypertension).  
  - Provides **general** (e.g., exercise) and **personalized** (condition-specific) recommendations.  

#### ActionPredictDiabetes
- **Purpose**: Estimates the user’s diabetes risk.  
- **How it works**:  
  - Collects user data (e.g., **age, BMI, glucose**).  
  - Uses a **machine learning model** to predict risk (**low, moderate, high**).  
  - Returns **actionable health tips**.  

#### ActionRememberName
- **Purpose**: Enhances conversations by **remembering user names**.  
- **How it works**:  
  - Extracts name from input and **stores it in a slot**.  
  - If missing, prompts the user to re-enter it.
