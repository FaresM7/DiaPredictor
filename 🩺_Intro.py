# Purpose of the Web App
st.markdown("### Purpose")
st.write(
    """
    The main goal of this app is to:
    
    - Explore and visualize the dataset used for diabetes prediction.
    - Demonstrate how data preprocessing impacts model performance.
    - Compare different regression models and evaluate their accuracy in predicting diabetes probabilities.
    - Provide an interactive and intuitive way to understand the importance of data transformations in machine learning.
